Hello, World 🌍!

👋 Hi, Thank you for stopping by. I’m Wonkwon Lee, a researcher with a mission to make AI as trustworthy as it is smart. While many are pushing the limits of what AI can do, I’m focused on how it does it. My research dives into ethical data modification and robust AI systems—ensuring AI doesn’t just learn, but learns responsibly. Think of it as giving AI a moral compass (because nobody wants a rebellious AI, right?).

🔐 My work spans differentially private data (keeping your data safe!) and improving vision model robustness (so AI can handle unexpected surprises). I believe that with the right balance of privacy and resilience, AI can become a tool that genuinely benefits society without unintended consequences.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
