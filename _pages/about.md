👋 Hello, I'm Wonkwon Raymond Lee!

I am a researcher with a mission to make AI as trustworthy as it is smart. 
My research interests are in trustworthy AI with an emphasis on security, robustness, interpretability, and fairness. 
I aim to develop robust and reliable AI systems-ensuring AI doesn’t just learn, but learns responsibly. 
Think of it as giving AI a moral compass.
