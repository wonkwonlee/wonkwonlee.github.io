Hello, World 🌍!

👋 Hi, Thank you for stopping by. I’m Wonkwon Lee, a researcher with a mission to make AI as trustworthy as it is smart. While many are pushing the limits of what AI can do, I’m focused on how it does it. My research dives into ethical data modification and robust AI systems—ensuring AI doesn’t just learn, but learns responsibly. Think of it as giving AI a moral compass (because nobody wants a rebellious AI, right?).
