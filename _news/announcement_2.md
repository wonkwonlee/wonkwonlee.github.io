My time at NYU was more than just *amazing* - I was fortunate to work with great professors and colleagues and also deeply enjoyed living in the Big Apple.

It was absolutely a **pleasure**.

As an international student, landed in America for the first time landing in the USA, New York City is an experience like no other. The diversity, the culture, and the energy of the city are unparalleled.

I am grateful for the opportunities and experiences that NYU and New York City have provided me. I look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I have gained in my future endeavors.

Thank you to everyone who supported me throughout this journey!
