This project provides a thorough out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness comparison across 58 state-of-the-art computer vision models. These include models based on vision transformers, convolutional networks, hybrid mechanisms, and more.

The research investigates how different architectures perform under various distribution shifts, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in terms of robustness.

## Summary

This work offers a comparative study of out-of-distribution robustness across 58 models, such as vision transformers, CNNs, hybrid models, and others. The analysis was conducted using a unified training setup, covering diverse models like convolution-based, attention-based, sequence-based, and more. The findings reveal how robustness varies depending on model type and the OOD type being evaluated.
