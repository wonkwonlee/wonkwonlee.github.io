## Introduction

Disease progression modeling (DPM) uses mathematical and scientific principles to describe the quantitative progression of a disease over time. One such task is to predict the three states of disease progression (improving, stable, or worsening) based on current and past chest X-ray images. This project fine-tunes and evaluates the pre-trained Torch X-ray Vision model for this temporal image classification task.

## Future Work

To improve the model, future research can explore semi-supervised learning techniques to handle missing data more effectively and investigate the use of lateral chest X-rays for enhanced predictive capabilities. Hyperparameter tuning of the Vision Transformer model can also lead to performance gains.
